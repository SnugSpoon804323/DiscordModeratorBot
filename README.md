# DiscordModeratorBot

Minecraft version: 1.20.1

An extension for the Minecraft Server Plugin EssentialsDiscord that allows members with specific roles (Moderators, MC-Moderators, ... ) to retrieve information  about a users linked Discord/Minecraft account for moderation purposes.

I wrote this plugin for private use for [The Clicks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPr3T20IPZ03gU9gZ2BwM5g) community discord server [The Clique](https://discord.com/servers/the-clique-460806595803217932), but the code should be public in any case. 

## Example config
See conf.yml
